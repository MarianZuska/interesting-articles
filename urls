*Introduction*
This document is filled with different articles that we found interesting and wanted to bookmark for the future.


*Mathematics*
The Most Dangerous Equation, http://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8863.pdf
- A paper about De Moivre's equation on the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean.

 - "[A] very basic intro to Gaussian Processes".
Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization, https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf
 - Why random search is better than grid search for finding good Hyper-Parameter configurations.
Avoiding side effects in complex environments, https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5kurn5W62C5CpSWq6/avoiding-side-effects-in-complex-environments
 - Reinforcement learning: How reward functions can be modified to avoid trickery.

  
*Off-topic/General*
The makersschedule, http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html
 - A blog post about the differences in schedule between makers and managers.
What you'll wish you'd known, http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html
